this is the description for Items.json
I moved the items into Items.json and imported it into App.jsx, to which the data will be looped through the file
Each items includes its id, name, price, and image URL.
(FYI I priced them according to my own memory, I am not 100% sure if they are how much they are marketed)
I decided to use the URL method instead of adding it into the assets folder because I think it will help the file to be less heavy when uploading.
Some images are 'slightly' off in terms of sizes, hope you don't mind that!
Also, each images are named with the flower breeds, but they are in a form of bouquet, thus there are some images that may include some other breeds of flowers.
