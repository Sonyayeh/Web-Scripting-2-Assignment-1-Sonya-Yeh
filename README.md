<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.`

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Description:
For this project, I want to create a fictional flower shop. I included the kinds of flowers I like. I designed the website based on the first flower I added, blue tulips. But because it would be too borning if it's just a plain background, I decided to add some gradient from blue to white, to mimic the blue sky. 

For Items.jsx, I couldn't add any comments to it, but it basically includes the information of each card: ID, name, price, and the image URL. 

Instructions to run the project:
since npm is already installed, you can just go to terminal and type these in order:
1: click terminal on the top navigation bar, or control + `
2: terminal should show "Sonya web scripting 1"
3: type "cd Flower-shop"
4: type "npm run dev"
5: wait for a second for the link to load, and select the blue link
(you can also hold the command key and click the link if you have a mac)

Challenges:
It is definitely difficult for me to do this project with React. I am not the best at coding, so I would say the main challenge is to understand what I am writing, and how I can describe what each code means, as I am terrible at describing things as well. Also, another challenge is to add in images. I wanted to add images through URL, but it took me more than 2 days to figure out how and where I can do it. The header wisteria image is a png and for some reason when I convert it into a URL it always turns into a jpeg. Thus, I had to create an assets folder, to which I use it to store the png image.
